% weather facts have 5 parameters:
%   1. a month (the usual 3-letter abbreviations, all lower case)
%   2. a day (an integer between 1 and 31)
%   3-5. three atoms describing the weather on this day.  The atoms
%        must contain one of (cold, cool, warm, hot) to describe
%        the temperature, one of (rain, snow, dry) to describe
%        precipitation if any, and one of (wind, calm) to tell if
%        there was much wind.  These three atoms may occur in any
%        order but must come after the month and the day.
